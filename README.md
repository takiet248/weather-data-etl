🌦️ Weather Data ETL Pipeline
📌 Project Overview
This project builds an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for weather data using Apache Airflow, PySpark, DBT, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Docker. The pipeline automates data ingestion, transformation, and loading into a database for analysis.

⚙️ Tech Stack
  Apache Airflow – Orchestrates the ETL workflow
  PySpark – Processes large-scale weather data
  DBT (Data Build Tool) – Transforms and models data
  Kafka – Streams real-time weather updates
  PostgreSQL – Stores cleaned and transformed data
  Docker – Containerizes the project for easy deployment
🔄 ETL Pipeline Workflow
  Extract
    Fetch weather data from an API or file (e.g., weather.csv).
    Ingest data into a raw storage layer.
  Transform
    Clean, process, and structure data using PySpark.
    Apply transformations and data modeling with DBT.
  Load
    Store the processed data in PostgreSQL.
    Enable downstream analytics and reporting.
🚀 How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-etl-pipeline.git
  cd weather-etl-pipeline
2️⃣ Start Docker Containers
  docker-compose up -d
3️⃣ Initialize & Start Airflow
    airflow db init
    airflow standalone
4️⃣ Run the ETL DAG in Airflow
    Open Airflow UI at http://localhost:8080
    Trigger the DAG: weather_etl_dag
📊 Expected Output
    A cleaned weather dataset stored in PostgreSQL.
    A fully automated Airflow DAG managing the ETL process.
📄 Future Improvements
  ✅ Implement data quality checks.
  ✅ Add support for real-time data ingestion.
  ✅ Integrate with a visualization tool (e.g., Power BI, Tableau).
